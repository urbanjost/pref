   This is a here document in the Bourne shell that in a GNU/Linux or Unix
   programming environment should show the HOME directory as $HOME and the
   user as $USER and the current date `date`.
   
   This could be any language or command (even another compiled program)
   that generates source code on stdout.
   
   This is very system-dependent and should be used very judiciously.
