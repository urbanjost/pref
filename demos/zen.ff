Grokking Fortran

Fast is better than slow
Slow is better than unmaintainable

Small functions are clearer than monolithic procedures
Simplicity is robustness
“Make everything as simple as possible – but no simpler” (Einstein)

Self-descriptive code is best
but comment

Make it look like the math

All inputs and outputs explicit
All inputs and outputs carefully named and clearly defined
the closer to the point of declaration the better
Be paranoid about parameters and check their validity coming and going

Array-oriented is better than object-oriented
Vector is better than loop
Matrix is better than vector
unless it’s complicated
Strided is better than scattered
Contiguous is better than strided
Broadcasting is a great idea
use where possible

Create tests large and small
and use them
Use every debug flag you have been given when developing

Write everything as if it was going to be reused
and share it
Package code and supporting files
like you were going to give them to a friend

“Rules are meant to be broken” (MacArthur, not Einstein)

Nice. More controversial, but I might add a few personal preferences
(and then snitch this very nice list; what would be a preferred
attribution?) …

  * self-descriptive code is best, but if you do not add comments and
    references someone will wish you had (probably you)

  * small functions are clearer than monolithic procedures (which are
    sometimes justifiable for performance, but should be avoided)

  * Use every debug flag you can while developing

  * The more compilers you use the better

  * Write everything as generically as you can and as if it was going to be reused (and share it)

  * profile your #*?! code (mostly an HPC thing, but you would not believe
    the things I find).

  * test your input and output values whenever the overhead
    is tolerable (make your routines paranoid!).

  * make tests
      + then test at the scale your users will use your code at x 10
      + next, test at the scale your users will use your code at x 100
      + and then test to failure.

  * package your code and supporting files like you were going to have to
    give it to a friend.

Yours beautifully cover optimizations, but a will add these more mundane
items and put this on a few desks, I think.

    what would be a preferred attribution?

Probably:

Ondřej Čertík, John Pask, Travis Oliphant, Tim Peters

John and I did the Fortran version, Travis did the NumPy version which
inspired us and Tim did the Python version which inspired Travis and
us. I hope I didn’t forget about anybody.

FWIW Tim Peters worked on a Fortran compiler for Kendall Square Research in the lab 80s, before he became involved with Python.
