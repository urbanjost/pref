.SH DESCRIPTION

A preprocessor traditionally is used to conditionally perform operations on
input files before they are passed to a compiler, including machine-specific
rules. This makes it possible to use a single source file even when different
code is required for different execution environments.
.PP
The \fBprep\fP(1) preprocessor has additional features that help to include
documentation in the same file as the source and to generate generic code
using a simple templating technique. The basic directives \.\.\..
.IP \(bu 3
Conditionally output parts of the source file (controlled by expressions
on the directives $if, $ifdef, $ifndef, $else, $elif, and $endif. The
expressions controlling the output may include variables defined on the
command line and the directives $define, $redefine, $define and $undefine).
.IP \(bu 3
Include other files (provided by directive $include).
.IP \(bu 3
Replace text of the form ${NAME} (controlled by directives $set
and $import).
.IP \(bu 3
Cause an error (controlled by directive $stop) and produce messages
on stderr (using the directive $message).
.IP \(bu 3
Define parcels of text that may be replayed multiple times with
expansion, allowing for basic templating (controlled by directives
$parcel and $post).
.IP \(bu 3
Generate multiple output files from a single input file (using
directive $output).
.IP \(bu 3
Filter blocks of text and convert them to comments, a character
variable, or Fortran WRITE statements \.\.\. (this is provided by
the $block directive).
.RS
.PP
Blocked text may be simultaneously written to a separate file, typically
for use as documentation.
.RE
.IP \(bu 3
Call system commands using the $system directive.
.IP \(bu 3
Record the parameters used and the date and time executed
as Fortran comments in the output using $show.
.PP
The pre-processor will interpret lines beginning with "$" (by default) in
column one as directives, and will output no such lines. Other input is
conditionally written to the output \fBfile\fP(s) based on the case-insensitive
command names.
.PP
An exclamation character FOLLOWED BY A SPACE on most directives
begins an in-line comment that is terminated by an end-of-line. The space
is required so comments are not confused with C-style logical operators such
as "!", which may NOT be followed by a space.
.PP
\fBprep\fP(1) supports string substitution and the inclusion of free-format
text blocks that may be converted to such things as Fortran comments or
CHARACTER variable definitions. Optionally, the text block may
simultaneously be used to generate documentation files.
.PP
Combined, strings substitution and repeatable text blocks allow for
basic templating.
.PP
INTEGER or LOGICAL expressions may be used on the family of $IF directives
to conditionally select output lines. An expression is composed of INTEGER
and LOGICAL constants, parameters, and operators. Operators are processed
as in Fortran and/or C expressions.

The suggested suffix for Fortran input files is ".ff" for code files unless
they contain $SYSTEM directives in which case ".FF" is preferred. $INCLUDE
files should use ".ffinc" and ".FFINC" if they include \fBprep\fP(1) directives.
This naming convention is not required.
.PP
The syntax for the directive lines is as follows:

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \fIdefine_list\fP, \fB-D\fP \fIdefine_list\fP
An optional space-delimited list of expressions
used to define variables before file processing
commences.
.TP
.B \fB-i\fP \fIinput_file(s)\fP
The default input file is stdin. Filenames are
space-delimited. In a list, @ represents stdin.
.TP
.B \fB-o\fP \fIoutput_file\fP
The default output file is stdout.
.TP
.B \fB-I\fP \fIinclude_directories\fP
The directories to search for files specified on
$INCLUDE directives.
.TP
.B \fB--prefix\fP ADE|letter
The default directive prefix character is "$".
Alternatives may be specified by providing an
ASCII Decimal Equivalent (Common values are 37=%
42=* 35=# 36=$ 64=@). If the value is not numeric
it is assumed to be a literal character.
.TP
.B \fB--noenv\fP
The $IFDEF and $IFNDEF directives test for an internal
\fBprep\fP(1) variable and then an environment variable by
by default. This option turns off testing for environment
variables.
.TP
.B \fB--type\fP FILETYPE
this flag indicates to skip input lines until after a
specific start string is encountered and to stop once a
specific end string is found left-justified on lines by
themselves.

                        none

.fam T

.RS
The special type "auto" may be specified, in which case
files will be processed according to their file suffix.
This allows for easily extracting code from common
document formats. This is particularly useful with extended
markdown formats, allowing for code source to be easily
documented and for tests in documents to be able to be
extracted and tested. "auto" switches processing mode
depending on input file suffix, treating supported file
prefixes ("md","html") appropriately.
.RE
.TP
.B \fB--start\fP STRING
Same as \fB--type\fP except along with \fB--stop\fP allows for custom
strings to be specified.
.TP
.B \fB--stop\fP STRING
Same as \fB--type\fP except along with \fB--start\fP allows for custom
strings to be specified.
.TP
.B \fB--system\fP
Allow system commands on $SYSTEM directives to
be executed.
.TP
.B \fB--keeptabs\fP
By default tab characters are expanded assuming
a stop has been set every eight columns; and
trailing carriage-return characters are removed.
Use this flag to prevent this processing from
occurring.
.TP
.B \fB--comment\fP
try to style comments generated in $BLOCK COMMENT blocks
for other utilities such as doxygen. Default is to
prefix lines with '! '. Allowed keywords are
currently "default", "doxygen","none","ford".
THIS IS AN ALPHA FEATURE AND NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED.
.TP
.B \fB--ident\fP
The output of the $IDENT directive is in the form of a
comment by default. If this flag is set the output is
of the form described in the $IDENT documentation
so executables and object code can contain the metadata
for use with the \fBwhat\fP(1) command. Note this generates an
unused variable which some compilers might optimize
away depending on what compilation options are used.
.TP
.B \fB-d\fP ignore|remove|blank
Enable special treatment for lines beginning
with "d" or "D" The letter will be left as-is
(the default); removed; or replaced with a blank
character. This non-standard syntax has been
used to support the optional compilation of
"debug" code by many Fortran compilers when
compiling fixed-format Fortran source.
.TP
.B \fB--width\fP \fIn\fP
Maximum line length of the output file. The default is 1024.
The parameter is typically used to trim fixed-format FORTRAN
code that contains comments or "ident" labels past column 72
when compiling fixed-format Fortran code.
.TP
.B \fB--verbose\fP
All commands on a $SYSTEM directive are echoed
to stderr with a + prefix. Text following the
string "@(#)" is printed to stderr similar to
the Unix command \fBwhat\fP(1) but is otherwise
treated as other text input.
.TP
.B \fB--version\fP
Display version and exit
.TP
.B \fB--help\fP
Display documentation and exit.
.SS   DIRECTIVES

$DEFINE|$REDEFINE variable_name [=expression]; \.\.\.
.PP
Defines a numeric or logical variable name and its value. The variable
name may be used in the expressions on the conditional output selector
directives $IF, $ELSEIF, $IFDEF, and $IFNDEF.
.PP
A $DEFINE may appear anywhere in a source file. If the result of
the expression is ".TRUE." or ".FALSE." then the parameter will
be of type LOGICAL, otherwise the parameter is of type INTEGER (and
the expression must be an INTEGER expression or null). If no value is
supplied the parameter is given the INTEGER value "1".
.PP
Variables are defined from the point they are declared in a $DEFINE
directive or the command line until program termination unless explicitly
undefined with a $UNDEFINE directive.
.PP
If a variable is already defined a $DEFINE generates a warning on stderr.
The $REDEFINE directive is identical to the $DEFINE directive accept no
warning is produced if the variable is already defined.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    > $define A=1
    > $define B = 10 - 1
    > $define C=1+1; D=(-40)/(-10)
    > $define bigd=d.ge.a; bigb = b >= c && b > 0
    > $if ( A + B ) / C .eq. 1
    >    (a+b)/c is one
    > $endif

.fam T
.fi
$UNDEFINE variable_name[; \.\.\.]
.PP
A symbol defined with $DEFINE can be removed with the $UNDEFINE directive.
Multiple names may be specified, preferably separated by semi-colons.
.PP
Basic globbing is supported, where "*" represents any string, and "?"
represents any single character.
.PP
\fBDEFINED\fP(variable_name)
.PP
A special function called \fBDEFINED\fP() may appear only in a $IF or $ELSEIF.
If "variable_name" has been defined at that point in the source code,
then the function value is ".TRUE.", otherwise it is ".FALSE.". A name is
defined only if it has appeared in the source previously in a $DEFINE
directive or been declared on the command line.
The names used in compiler directives are district from names in the
FORTRAN source, which means that "a" in a $DEFINE and "a" in a FORTRAN
source statement are totally unrelated.
The \fBDEFINED\fP() parameter is NOT valid in a $DEFINE directive.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    >        Program test
    > $IF .NOT. DEFINED (inc)
    >        INCLUDE "comm.inc"
    > $ELSE
    >        INCLUDE "comm2.inc"
    > $ENDIF
    >        END

.fam T
.fi
The file, "comm.inc" will be included in the source if the variable
"inc", has not been previously defined, while INCLUDE "comm2.inc" will
be included in the source if "inc" has been defined.
.PP
Predefined variables are
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    SYSTEMON = 1 if the --system switch was used on the command line, else 0.

    UNKNOWN = 0 LINUX   = 1 MACOS   = 2 WINDOWS = 3
    CYGWIN  = 4 SOLARIS = 5 FREEBSD = 6 OPENBSD = 7
    In addition OS is set to what the program guesses the system type is.

.nf
.fam C
     > $if OS == LINUX
     >    write(*,*)"System type is Linux"
     > $elseif OS == WINDOWS
     >    write(*,*)"System type is MSWindows"
     > $else
     >    write(*,*)"System type is unknown"
     > $endif

.fam T
.fi
$IF/$ELSEIF/$ELSE/$ENDIF directives
.PP
Each of these control lines delineates a block of source lines. If the
expression following the $IF is ".TRUE.", then the following lines of
source following are output. If it is ".FALSE.", and an $ELSEIF
follows, the expression is evaluated and treated the same as the $IF. If
the $IF and all $ELSEIF expressions are ".FALSE.", then the lines of
source following the optional $ELSE are output. A matching $ENDIF ends the
conditional block.
.PP
$IFDEF/$IFNDEF directives
.PP
$IFDEF and $IFNDEF are special forms of the $IF directive that simply test
if a variable name is defined or not.
.PP
Essentially, these are equivalent:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
     $IFDEF varname  ==> $IF DEFINED(varname)
     $IFNDEF varname ==> $IF .NOT. DEFINED(varname)

.fam T
.fi
except that environment variables are tested as well by $IFDEF and $IFNDEF
if the \fB--noenv\fP option is not specified, but never by the function \fBDEFINED\fP(),
allowing for environment variables to be selectively used or ignored.
The \fB--noenv\fP switch is therefore only needed for compatibility with \fBfpp\fP(1).
For the purposes of \fBprep\fP(1) an environment variable is defined if it is
returned by the system and has a non-blank value.
.PP
$IDENT metadata [-language fortran|c|shell]
.PP
$IDENT is a special-purpose directive generally used only by users of
SCCS-metadata. This string is generally included for use with the
\fBwhat\fP(1) command, and generates a comment if "\fB-ident\fP" is not specified
on the command line.
.PP
When the command line option "\fB-ident\fP" is specified this directive
writes a line using SCCS-metadata format of one of the following forms:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
     language:
     fortran   character(len=*),parameter::ident="@(#)metadata"
     c         #ident "@(#)metadata"
     shell     #@(#) metadata

.fam T
.fi
"$@(#)" is an alias for "$IDENT" so the source file itself will contain
SCCS-metadata so the metadata can be displayed with \fBwhat\fP(1) even for the
unprocessed files.
.PP
The default language is "fortran". Depending on your compiler and the
optimization level used when compiling, the output strings may or may not
remain in the object files and executables created.
.PP
Do not use the characters double-quote, greater-than, backslash (ie. ">\\)
in the metadata to remain compatible with SCCS metadata syntax.
Do not use strings starting with " -" either.
.PP
$OUTPUT filename [-append [.true.|.false.]]
.PP
Specify the output file to write to. This overrides the initial output file
specified with command line options. If no output filename is given
\fBprep\fP(1) reverts back to the initial output file. @ is a synonym for stdout.
.PP
Files open at the beginning by default. Use the \fB-append\fP switch to
append to the end of an existing file instead of overwriting it.
.PP
$INCLUDE filename
.PP
Read in the specified input file. Fifty (50) nesting levels are allowed.
Following the tradition of \fBcpp\fP(1) if "<filename>" is specified the file is
only searched for relative to the search directories, otherwise it is
searched for as specified first. Double-quotes are treated as in Fortran
list-directed input.
.PP
$PARCEL [name]
.PP
The lines between a "$PARCEL name" and "$PARCEL" block are written to a
scratch file WITHOUT expanding directives. the scratch file can then be read
in with the $POST directive much like a named file can be with $INCLUDE,
except the scratch file is automatically deleted at program termination.
.PP
$POST name
.PP
Read in the scratch file created by the $PARCEL directive. Combined with
$SET and $IMPORT directives this allows you to replay a section of input
and replace strings as a simple templating technique, or to repeat lines
like copyright information or definitions of (obsolescent) Fortran COMMON
blocks, put contained in source files without the need for separate
INCLUDE files or error-prone repetition of the declarations.
.PP
$SET name string
.PP
If a $SET directive defines a name \fBprep\fP(1) enters expansion mode. In this
mode anywhere the string "${NAME}" is encountered in subsequent output it
is replaced by "string". Comments should not be used on a $SET directive.
Note expansion of a line may cause it to be longer than allowed by some
compilers. Automatic breaking into continuation lines does not occur.
.PP
IF A $SET DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN DEFINED the "standard" preprocessor values
${FILE}, ${LINE}, ${DATE}, and ${TIME} are also available. The time
refers to the time of processing, not the time of compilation or loading.
.PP
$IMPORT name[;\.\.\.]
.PP
The values of environment variables may be imported just like their names
and values were used on a $SET directive. The names of the variables are
case-sensitive in regards to obtaining the values, but the names become
values, but the names because case-insensitive in \fBprep\fP(). That is,
"import home" gets the lowercase environment variable "home" and then sets
the associated value and then sets the \fBprep\fP(1) variable "HOME" to the value.

If the "\fB-file\fP NAME" option is present the text is written to the
specified file unfiltered except for string expansion. This allows
documentation to easily be maintained in the source file. It can be
tex, html, markdown or any plain text. The filename will be prefixed
with $PREP_DOCUMENT_DIR/doc/ . If the environment variable
$PREP_DOCUMENT_DIR is not set the option is ignored.
.PP
The \fB--file\fP output can easily be processed by other utilities such
as \fBmarkdown\fP(1) or \fBtxt2man\fP(1) to produce \fBman\fP(1) pages and HTML

A value of "0" causes normal program termination.
.IP \(bu 3
The default value is "1".
.IP \(bu 3
If a message is supplied it is displayed to stderr.
.IP \(bu 3
The default message if the value is not "0" is to display the program
state like a "$SHOW" directive.
.PP
"$QUIT" is an alias for "$STOP 0". "$ERROR" is a synonym for "$STOP 1"

$SYSTEM system_command
.PP
If system command processing is enabled using the \fB--system\fP switch system
commands can be executed for such tasks as creating files to be read or to
further process documents created by $BLOCK. $SYSTEM directives are errors
by default; as you clearly need to ensure the input file is trusted before
before allowing commands to be executed. Commands that are system-specific
may need to be executed conditionally as well.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    > $! build variable definitions using GNU/Linux commands
    > $SYSTEM echo system=`hostname` > compiled.h
    > $SYSTEM echo compile_time="`date`" >> compiled.h
    > $INCLUDE compiled.h

    > $if systemon ! if --system switch is present on command line
    > $!  obtain up-to-date copy of source file from HTTP server:
    > $   SYSTEM wget http://repository.net/src/func.F90 -O - >_tmp.f90
    > $   INCLUDE _tmp.f90
    > $   SYSTEM  rm _tmp.f90
    > $endif

.fam T
.fi
$MESSAGE message
.PP
Write message to stderr.
.PP
Note that messages for $MESSAGE do not treat "! " as starting a comment
.SH LIMITATIONS

$IF constructs can be nested up to 20 levels deep. Note that using
more than two levels typically makes input files less readable.
.PP
$BLOCK is required after a $BLOCK or \fB--file\fP FILENAME is not written.
.PP
Nesting of $BLOCK sections not allowed.
$INCLUDE may be nested fifty (50) levels.
.PP
Input files
.IP \(bu 3
lines are limited to a maximum of 1024 columns. Text past the limit is
ignored.
.IP \(bu 3
files cannot be concurrently opened multiple times
.IP \(bu 3
a maximum of 50 files can be nested by $INCLUDE
.IP \(bu 3
filenames cannot contain spaces on the command line.
.PP
Variable names
.IP \(bu 3
are limited to 31 characters.
.IP \(bu 3
must start with a letter (A-Z).
.IP \(bu 3
are composed of the letters A-Z, digits 0-9 and _ and $.
.IP \(bu 3
2048 variable names may be defined at a time.
.SH EXAMPLES

Define variables on command line:
.PP
Typically, variables are defined on the command line when \fBprep\fP(1) is
invoked but can be grouped together into small files that are included
with a $INCLUDE or as input files.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    > prep HP size=64 -i hp_directives.dirs test.F90 -o test_out.f90

.fam T
.fi
defines variables HP and SIZE as if the expressions had been on a
$DEFINE and reads file "hp_directives.dirs" and then test.F90.
Output is directed to test_out.f90
.PP
Basic conditionals:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
   > $! set variable "a" if not specified on the prep(1) command.
   > $IF .NOT.DEFINED(A)
   > $   DEFINE a=1  ! so only define the first version of SUB(3f) below
   > $ENDIF
   >    program conditional_compile
   >       call sub()
   >    end program conditional_compile
   > $! select a version of SUB depending on the value of variable "a"
   > $IF a .EQ. 1
   >    subroutine sub
   >       print*, "This is the first SUB"
   >    end subroutine sub
   > $ELSEIF a .eq. 2
   >    subroutine sub
   >       print*, "This is the second SUB"
   >    end subroutine sub
   > $ELSE
   >    subroutine sub
   >       print*, "This is the third SUB"
   >    end subroutine sub
   > $ENDIF

Common use of $BLOCK
.PP
.nf
.fam C
   > $!
   > $BLOCK NULL --file manual.tex
   > This is a block of text that will be ignored on output but
   > optionally written to a doc/ file when $PREP_DOCUMENT_DIR is set.
   > $BLOCK
   > $!
   > $BLOCK COMMENT --file manual.tex --append
   > This is a block of text that will be converted to comments and

.SS SET USAGE
Note values are case-sensitive but variable names are not, and there are
pre-defined values for input file, line in input file, date and time that
are NOT ACTIVE until at least one $SET or $IMPORT directive is processed.
That is, unless a variable name is defined no ${NAME} expansion occurs.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
   > $set author  William Shakespeare
   > $import HOME
   > write(*,*)'By ${AUTHOR}'
   > write(*,*)'File ${FILE}'
   > write(*,*)'Line ${LINE}'
   > write(*,*)'Date ${DATE}'
   > write(*,*)'Time ${TIME}'

.SH NOTE
Not documented elsewhere, note that there is a developer flag (\fB--debug\fP) that
can be useful when learning proper \fBprep\fP(1) usage (but it should not be used in
production). Among other things it deactivates the termination of the program
upon detection of an error. This mode thus allows for simple interactive use.
In addition, when in this mode entering "$HELP" produces a cribsheet.
