DESCRIPTION

   By default the pre-processor prep(1) will interpret lines with "$" in column
   one, and will output no such lines. Other input is conditionally written to
   the output file based on the directives encountered in the input. It does
   not support parameterized macros but does support string substitution and
   the inclusion of free-format text blocks that may be converted to Fortran
   comments or CHARACTER variable definitions while simultaneously being used
   to generate documentation files. INTEGER or LOGICAL expressions may be used
   to select output lines.

   The suggested suffix for Fortran input files is ".ff" for code files unless
   they contain $SYSTEM directives in which case ".FF" is preferred. $INCLUDE
   files should use ".ffinc" and ".FFINC" if they include prep(1) directives.
   This naming convention is not required.

   An exclamation character on a valid directive begins an in-line comment
   that is terminated by an end-of-line.

   An expression is composed of INTEGER and LOGICAL constants, parameters
   and operators. Operators are

     .NOT.  .AND.  .OR.  .EQV.  .NEQV.  .EQ.  .NE.  .GE.
     .GT.   .LE.   .LT.  +      -       *     /     (
     )      **

   The syntax for the directive lines is as follows:

     $DEFINE   variable_name[=expression]                 [! comment ]
     $UNDEFINE variable_name                              [! comment ]

OPTIONS
   define_list, -D define_list  An optional space-delimited list of expressions
                                used to define variables before file processing
                                commences.
   -i input_files               The default input file is stdin. Filenames are
                                space-delimited. In a list, @ represents stdin.
   -o output_file               The default output file is stdout.
   -I include_directories       The directories to search for files specified on
                                $INCLUDE directives.
   --prefix ADE|letter  The default directive prefix character is "$".
                        Alternatives may be specified by providing an
                        ASCII Decimal Equivalent (Common values are 37=%
                        42=* 35=# 36=$ 64=@). If the value is not numeric
                        it is assumed to be a literal character.

   --help           Display documentation and exit.
   --verbose        All commands on a $SYSTEM directive are echoed
                    to stderr with a + prefix. Text following the
                    string "@(#)" is printed to stderr similar to
                    the Unix command what(1) but is otherwise
                    treated as other text input.

   --noenv          The $IFDEF and $IFNDEF directives test for an
                    internal prep(1) variable and then an
                    environment variable by default. This option
                    turns off testing for environment variables.
   --system         Allow system commands on $SYSTEM directives to
                    be executed.
   --keeptabs       By default tab characters are expanded assuming
                    a stop has been set every eight columns; and
                    trailing carriage-return characters are removed.
                    Use this flag to prevent this processing from
                    occurring.
   --comment        try to style comments generated in $BLOCK blocks
                    for other utilities such as doxygen. Default is to
                    prefix lines with '! '. Allowed keywords are
                    currently "default", "doxygen","none","ford".
                    THIS IS AN ALPHA FEATURE AND NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED.
   -d ignore|remove|blank  Enable special treatment for lines beginning
                           with "d" or "D" The letter will be left as-is
                           (the default); removed; or replaced with a blank
                           character. This non-standard syntax has been
                           used to support the optional compilation of
                           "debug" code by many Fortran compilers when
                           compiling fixed-format Fortran source.
   --version        Display version and exit
   --width n        Maximum line length of the output file. The default is 1024.
                    Typically used to trim fixed-format FORTRAN code that
                    contains comments or "ident" labels past column 72 when
                    when compiling fixed-format Fortran code.

   DIRECTIVES

   $DEFINE variable_name [=expression]

   A $DEFINE may appear anywhere in a source file. If the value is ".TRUE."
   or ".FALSE." then the parameter is of type LOGICAL, otherwise the
   parameter is of type INTEGER and the value must be an INTEGER. If no
   value is supplied, the parameter is of type INTEGER and is given the
   value 1.

   Constant parameters are defined from the point they are encountered in a
   $DEFINE directive until program termination unless explicitly
   undefined with a $UNDEFINE directive.

   Example:

    $define A=1
    $define B=1
    $define C=2
    $if ( A + B ) / C .eq. 1
       (a+b)/c is one
    $endif

   $IF/$ELSEIF/$ELSE/$ENDIF directives

   Each of the control lines delineates a block of FORTRAN source. If the
   expression following the $IF is ".TRUE.", then the lines of FORTRAN
   source following are output. If it is ".FALSE.", and an $ELSEIF
   follows, the expression is evaluated and treated the same as the $IF. If
   the $IF and all $ELSEIF expressions are ".FALSE.", then the lines of
   source following the $ELSE are output. A matching $ENDIF ends the
   conditional block.

   $IFDEF/$IFNDEF directives

   $IFDEF and $IFNDEF are special forms of the $IF directive that simply test
   if a variable name is defined or not. Essentially, these are equivalent:

     $IFDEF varname  ==> $IF DEFINED(varname)
     $IFNDEF varname ==> $IF .NOT. DEFINED(varname)

   except that environment variables are tested as well if the --noenv option
   is not specified.

   $IDENT metadata [-language fortran|c|shell]

   Writes a line using SCCS-metadata format of the following forms:

     language:
     fortran   character(len=*),parameter::ident="@(#)metadata"
     c         #ident "@(#)metadata"
     shell     #@(#) metadata

   This string is generally included for use with the what(1) command.

   "$@(#)" is an alias for "$IDENT" so the source file itself will contain
   SCCS-metadata so the metadata can be displayed with what(1).

   The default language is "fortran". Depending on your compiler and the
   optimization level used when compiling, these strings may or may not
   remain in the object files and executables created.

   Do not use the characters double-quote, greater-than, backslash (">\)
   in the metadata to remain compatible with SCCS metadata syntax.
   Do not use strings starting with " -" either.

   $OUTPUT filename [-append]

   Specify the output file to write to. Overrides the initial output file
   specified with command line options. If no output filename is given
   revert back to initial output file. @ is a synonym for stdout.

      -append [.true.|.false]

   Named files open at the beginning by default. Use the -append switch to
   append to the end of an existing file instead of overwriting it.

   $INCLUDE filename

   Nested read of specified input file. Fifty (50) nesting levels are allowed.

   $PARCEL [name]

   The lines between a "$PARCEL name" and "$PARCEL" block are written WITHOUT
   expanding directives to a scratch file that can then be read in with the
   $POST directive much like a named file can be with $INCLUDE.

   $POST name

   Read in the scratch file created by the $PARCEL directive. Combined with
   $SET directives this allows you to replay a section of input and replace
   strings as a simple templating technique.

   $SET name string

   If a $SET directive defines a name prep(1) enters expansion mode. In this
   mode anywhere the string "${NAME}" is encountered in subsequent output it
   is replaced by "string". Comments should not be used on a $SET directive.
   Note expansion of a line may cause it to be longer than allowed by some
   compilers. Automatic breaking into continuation lines does not occur.

   IF A $SET DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN DEFINED the "standard" preprocessor values
   ${FILE}, ${LINE}, ${DATE}, and ${TIME} are also available. The time
   data refers to the time of processing, not the current time nor the time
   of compilation or loading.

   $IMPORT names(s)

   The values of environment variables may be imported such that their names
   and values will be set as if a $SET command had been done on them.

   $BLOCK [comment|null|write|help|version  [-file NAME [-append]]
     or
   $BLOCK VARIABLE --varname NAME  [--file NAME]

      COMMENT:   write text prefixed by an exclamation and a space
      WRITE:     write text as Fortran WRITE(3f) statements
                 The Fortran generated is free-format. It is assumed the
                 output will not generate lines over 132 columns.
      HELP:      write text as a subroutine called HELP_USAGE
      VERSION:   write text as a subroutine called HELP_VERSION prefixing
                 lines with @(#) for use with the what(1) command.
      NULL:      Do not write into current output file
      VARIABLE:  write as a text variable. The name may be defined using
                 the --varname switch. Default name is "textblock".
      END:       End block of specially processed text

   If the "-file NAME" option is present the *unaltered* text is written to
   the specified file. This allows documentation to easily be maintained in
   the source file. It can be tex, html, markdown or any plain text.
   The filename will be prefixed with $PREP_DOCUMENT_DIR/doc/ . If the
   environment variable $PREP_DOCUMENT_DIR is not set the option is ignored.

   The text can easily be processed by other utilities such as markdown(1)
   or txt2man(1) to produce man(1) pages and HTML documents. $SYSTEM commands
   may follow the $BLOCK block text to optionally post-process the doc files.

   A blank value or "END" returns to normal output processing.

   $SHOW

   Shows current state of prep(1); including variable names and values; and
   the name of the current input files. All output is preceded by an
   exclamation character.

   Example:

    prep A=10 B C D -o paper
    $define z=22
    $show
    $stop 0

     > !================================================================
     > !
     > ! Current state of prep(1):(18:39 20 Jun 2021)

     > ! Open files:

     > !    $DEFINE OPENBSD  =  7
     > !    $DEFINE OS  =  1
     > !    $DEFINE A  =  10
     > !    $DEFINE B  =  1
     > !    $DEFINE C  =  1
     > !    $DEFINE D  =  1
     > !    $DEFINE Z  =  22
     > !================================================================

   $STOP stop_value

   Stops input file processing. An optional integer value of 0 to 20
   will be returned as a status value to the system where supported. A
   value of two ("2") is returned if no value is specified. Any value
   from one ("1") to twenty ("20") also causes an implicit execution of
   the "$SHOW" directive before the program is stopped. A value of "0"
   causes normal program termination. "$QUIT" is an alias for "$STOP 0".

   $SYSTEM system_command

   If system command processing is enabled using the --system switch system
   commands can be executed for such tasks as creating files to be read or to
   further process documents created by $BLOCK. $SYSTEM directives are ignored
   by default; as you clearly need to ensure the input file is trusted before
   before allowing commands to be executed. Commands that are system-specific
   may need to be executed conditionally as well.

   Examples:

    $! build variable definitions using GNU/Linux commands
    $SYSTEM echo system=`hostname` > compiled.h
    $SYSTEM echo compile_time="`date`" >> compiled.h
    $INCLUDE compiled.h

    $! obtain up-to-date copy of source file from HTTP server:
    $SYSTEM wget http://repository.net/src/func.F90 -O - >_tmp.f90
    $INCLUDE _tmp.f90
    $SYSTEM  rm _tmp.f90

   $UNDEFINE variable_name

   A symbol defined with $DEFINE can be removed with the $UNDEFINE
   directive.

   DEFINED(variable_name)

   A special function called DEFINED() may appear only in a $IF or $ELSEIF.
   If "variable_name" has been defined at that point in the source code,
   then the function value is ".TRUE.", otherwise it is ".FALSE.". A name is
   defined only if it has appeared in the source previously in a $DEFINE
   directive or been declared on the command line.
   The names used in compiler directives are district from names in the
   FORTRAN source, which means that "a" in a $DEFINE and "a" in a FORTRAN
   source statement are totally unrelated.
   The DEFINED() parameter is NOT valid in a $DEFINE directive.

   Example:

    >        Program test
    > $IF .NOT. DEFINED (inc)
    >        INCLUDE ''comm.inc''
    > $ELSE
    >        INCLUDE ''comm2.inc''
    > $ENDIF
    >        END

   The file, "comm.inc" will be INCLUDEd in the source if the parameter,
   "inc", has not been previously defined, while INCLUDE "comm2.inc" will
   be included in the source if "inc" has been previously defined. This is
   useful for setting up a default inclusion.

   Predefined values are

    UNKNOWN = 0 LINUX   = 1 MACOS   = 2 WINDOWS = 3
    CYGWIN  = 4 SOLARIS = 5 FREEBSD = 6 OPENBSD = 7
    In addition OS is set to what the program guesses the system type is.

   $MESSAGE WARNING message

   Write message to stderr

LIMITATIONS

   $IF constructs can be nested up to 20 levels deep. Note that using
   more than two levels typically makes input files less readable.

   $BLOCK END is required after a $BLOCK or --file FILENAME is not written.

   Nesting of $BLOCK sections not allowed.

   Messages for $MESSAGE do not treat an exclamation as starting a comment

  Input files

   o lines are limited to 1024 columns. Text past column 1024 is ignored.
   o files currently opened cannot be opened again.
   o a maximum of 50 files can be nested by $INCLUDE
   o filenames cannot contain spaces on the command line.

 Variable names

   o cannot be redefined unless first undefined.
   o are limited to 31 characters.
   o must start with a letter (A-Z).
   o are composed of the letters A-Z, digits 0-9 and _ and $.
   o 2048 variable names may be defined at a time.

EXAMPLES

  Define variables on command line:

   Typically, variables are defined on the command line when prep(1) is
   invoked but can be grouped together into small files that are included
   with a $INCLUDE or as input files.

     prep HP size=64 -i hp_directives.dirs test.F90 -o test_out.f90

   defines variables HP and SIZE as if the expressions had been on a
   $DEFINE and reads file "hp_directives.dirs" and then test.F90.
   Output is directed to test_out.f90

  Basic conditionals:

   > $! set variable "a" if not specified on the prep(1) command.
   > $IF .NOT.DEFINED(A)
   > $   DEFINE a=1  ! so only define the first version of SUB(3f) below
   > $ENDIF
   >    program conditional_compile
   >       call sub()
   >    end program conditional_compile
   > $! select a version of SUB depending on the value of variable "a"
   > $IF a .EQ. 1
   >    subroutine sub
   >       print*, "This is the first SUB"
   >    end subroutine sub
   > $ELSEIF a .eq. 2
   >    subroutine sub
   >       print*, "This is the second SUB"
   >    end subroutine sub
   > $ELSE
   >    subroutine sub
   >       print*, "This is the third SUB"
   >    end subroutine sub
   > $ENDIF

  Common use of $BLOCK

   > $!
   > $BLOCK NULL --file manual.tex
   > This is a block of text that will be ignored on output but
   > optionally written to a doc/ file when $PREP_DOCUMENT_DIR is set.
   > $BLOCK END
   > $!
   > $BLOCK COMMENT --file manual.tex --append
   > This is a block of text that will be converted to comments and
   > optionally appended to a doc/ file when $PREP_DOCUMENT_DIR is set.
   > $BLOCK END
   > $!

 SET USAGE
  Note values are case-sensitive but variable names are not, and there are
  pre-defined values for input file, line in input file, date and time that
  are NOT ACTIVE until at least one $SET or $IMPORT directive is processed.
  That is, unless a variable name is defined no ${NAME} expansion occurs.
